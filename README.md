# UART Transmitter & Receiver (Verilog)

> A configurable UART communication module built in Verilog, complete with waveform-level simulation and testbench verification.

## 🔧 Project Overview

This project implements a **Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)** system using Verilog. UART is a fundamental communication protocol in embedded systems, enabling asynchronous serial communication between devices such as microcontrollers, sensors, and computers.

The project includes:
- **UART Transmitter** module
- **UART Receiver** module
- **Self-checking testbench**
- **Waveform visualization using GTKWave**

## ✨ Features

- 📡 **Serial Data Transmission & Reception**: Implements the core logic of TX and RX state machines.
- ⚙️ **Configurable Baud Rate**: Easily parameterized to support different baud rates.
- 🔄 **8-bit Data Support**: Basic and widely used data width.
- 🧪 **Simulation-Testbench**: Validates behavior using edge-aligned test scenarios.
- 📈 **Waveform Visualization**: Signal-level debugging and verification via `.vcd` files and GTKWave.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Verilog** (RTL Design)
- **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** – Simulation and compilation
- **GTKWave** – Waveform analysis
- **VSCode** with MSYS2/MinGW integration
- **GitHub** – Version control & project hosting

## 📌 Learning & Impact

This project was a hands-on exploration of **hardware communication protocols**, **FSM design**, and **timing control in digital systems**. It deepened my understanding of **synchronous design**, **clock domain handling**, and **verification practices**.

## 💡 Why UART?

UART is ubiquitous across embedded platforms, making it a perfect project to demonstrate practical RTL design skills, while still being small enough to verify thoroughly in a constrained timeline. It serves as a critical building block in real-world systems and is commonly referenced in **FPGA**, **ASIC**, and **SoC** designs.
